- 👋 Hi, I’m Steve Eckhardt (@dr-eck)
- 👀 I’m interested in high performance numerical calculations (ray tracing and matrix operations).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to move from MFC to C++/WinRT.  Kudos to Kenny Kerr for making it possible for straight C++ programmers to acces Windows in a modern way!  
- 💞️ I’m not currently looking to collaborate on anything.  However, I'd love to find someone to take some Beaglebone programming off my plate.
- 📫 You can reach me by email to steve@eckop.com
